# HTML-CSS
a simple user interface created using HTML and CSS. The user interface is a landing page that contains a form

## HTML

The html approach implements the `html` structure and a basic form that allows clients to make orders on what they would like to eat.

```html
<head>
  Restaurant
</head>
<body>
  <!-- food offered -->
  <!-- form -->
  <form></form>
</body>
```
## CSS

There are two css files. One that resets basic css styles to a base line and another that custom styles the landing page. The custom css file also implements some CSS3 styles in the design

```css
input[type='submit']{
  /*some styling code*/
}

```
